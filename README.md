# D&D Class Picker
This is a small app to assist new D&amp;D players in picking a class and subclass, based on the Player's Handbook. It'll be expanded over time to include supplemental materials.

Currently there is not a lot to this, but hopefully as I continue iterating, future versions will be more robust. Eventually, I'd like to have a full race/class/background picker, so someone completely new to the hobby can go through, answer a few questions, and come out with a full character concept.

## Todos

- [ ] Visually list available classes along the top
- [ ] Create list of branching binary choices to narrow down class search
- [ ] As questions are answered, class options along top are greyed out
- [ ] After exhausting class options, follow-up questions narrow down sub-class
- [ ] Once a single class and sublclass have been selected, a modal pops up showing the selection, alongside a button to start over
